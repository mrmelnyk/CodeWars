    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
    You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you.<br/>
    Each character has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1 (allways 2 for Java).<br/>

    You can not use multiplier "*" operator.<br/>

    If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).
