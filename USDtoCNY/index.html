    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY).
     The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'<br/>
     The conversion rate you should use is 6.75 CNY for every 1 USD. All numbers should be represented as a string with 2 decimal places. (e.g. "21.00" NOT "21.0" or "21")
