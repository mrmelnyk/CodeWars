CodeWars - My Profile
This is a repo to hold the coding challenges that I have completed through the Code Wars webiste. 
The challenge that I have set for myself is to complete and commit a new challenge every day. Each challenge will have an HTML file and a JS file. The HTML file will have the instructions and examples of the challenge, and the JS file will have the solution to the challenge.
I will be starting out with only JS challenges, but will eventually move into other languages.
