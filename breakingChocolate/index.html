    <p>
        Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable.<br/>
         Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.
