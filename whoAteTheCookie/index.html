    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie.<br/> 
        If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie.<br/> 
        The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"<br/>

        Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! (The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)
